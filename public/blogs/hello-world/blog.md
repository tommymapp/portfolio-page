## Hello world

This is my first ever blog!

This blogs going to be deleted, but ultimatley I'm writing this to set some goals for the next few weeks.

It's the 12th, and I am on garden leave until the 2nd Feb (absolutley insane, I know)

There's a few things I'd like to do / ideas:
- Write a postmortem about my time at durell
- Create a project section featuring this site
- Create 3D rubix cube in threejs
- Do some .net core api project 
- Create a virtual corkboard (seems like fun)

Maybe the postmortem, project section with an associated blog, and virtual corkboard are most likely
